	<p>A native of Tullamore, County Offaly, Ireland, Thomas Bracken began Irish 
	step-dancing at the age of four. He attended the Sheehan School and later 
	joined the famed Inis Ealga School in Dublin. He is a recipient of many 
	regional, national and world medals as both a dancer and a teacher.</p>

	<p>The Bracken School of Irish Dance was founded in Ireland in 1980 by 
	Thomas Bracken ADCRG. Thomas is a graduate of University College Dublin and 
	has specialized in education and the Arts for the past 25 years. His 
	experience as a senior high school administrator facilitates the educational 
	foundation of this dance school. He also holds the highest accreditation 
	afforded to an Irish Dance teacher which is the equivalent of the Masters 
	Degree.</p>

	<p>Thomas has conducted master classes throughout the US, Canada and 
	Australia for the past 20 years and he had the honour of judging at the 
	World Irish Dance Championships on a number of occasions.</p>

	<p>A seasoned performer, Thomas has performed at such world renowned venues 
	as Carnegie Hall, New York and the Royal Albert Hall in London. His students 
	have performed throughout mainland Europe and have featured in a number of 
	television specials, folk dance festivals and charity events throughout the 
	US and Canada.</p>

	<p>They have also performed with such world famous acts such as the 
	Chieftains and Cherish the Ladies and most recently the dance school 
	performed with both the Phoenix and San Diego Symphonies for their sell out 
	winter pop concerts. A number of Mr Bracken's former students now grace the 
	stage in both Riverdance and Lord of the Dance and have toured the world 
	extensively.</p>

	<p>The School has achieved great success in competition throughout the 
	years. The school boasts a World Champion and 1st runner up as well as 
	numerous medals. In 2005, the school's senior mixed ceile team placed second 
	in the North American Championships and took seventh place at the World 
	Championships in Ennis, Ireland, with two of its' students placing 5th &amp;
	7th in solo competitions.</p>

	<p>In July 2006, John Smith of the Bracken School, Poway Ca., outshone 
	competition from the 2006 All Ireland and World Champions to accomplish a 
	personal ambition and bring great honour to the Bracken School by placing 
	first in the North American Junior Men's Championship.</p>

	<p>The school was ranked #12 in North America by Irish Dance Magazine 
	International in its league of most successful Irish Dancing Schools.</p>

	<p>Whilst the school is very accomplished in competition and performance, it 
	has at its grassroots the mission to introduce this cultured art form to as 
	wide a group of people as possible, so that they may enjoy it and add it to 
	their cultural experience in life. We share the joy and discipline of an age 
	old genre of dance which has become a modern Broadway sensation.</p>

	<p>It has to start somewhere and nowhere better than the local community. 
	This great dance phenomenon has grown from local classes worldwide to become 
	the very popular art form of today.</p>
